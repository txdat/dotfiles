# Approval — Single Source

Owns every human approval in the dev flow: the **application spec** (`Type: feature|fix|refactor` plans) and the **architecture decision** (`docs/architecture/**`). No other file states, restates, or qualifies the conditions of approval; they point here.

## Application spec

One decision, one pause. Precondition: the plan carries `Review: READY <date>` from an actual review-feature verdict. Missing → there is nothing to approve yet; run review-feature.

1. Show the Goal, then every AC and TC by ID — each on its own line, full text, no summarizing. Add slice/step counts, key risks, and issue state.
2. Ask: **`Approve this spec? Reply "approve", or name the AC/TC IDs to revise or drop.`**
3. Pause. Only an explicit approval sets `Status: approved`.

A response that names IDs is a revision: apply the edit, delete a dropped item outright (git history is the audit trail — do not keep tombstones), and route back through review-feature before asking again.

Silence, a general "proceed", prior agreement on the Goal, urgency, and a bug report are **not** approvals. Neither is your own confidence. Nothing else in the flow may set `Status: approved`.

## Architecture

Same shape, different artifact, and it happens **before** any feature plan is written. Precondition: review-system reported `READY` on a `Status: draft` document.

1. Show the recommendation, the decisive trade-offs, the phases, and the plan decomposition.
2. Ask: **`Approve this architecture? Reply "approve", or name what to revise.`**
3. Pause. Only an explicit approval sets `Status: approved` on the document. Revisions return through design-system and review-system.

Approving an architecture approves *boundaries*, never application behavior: each decomposed feature plan still comes back through the spec pause above. Any later semantic change returns the document to `draft` for fresh review and a fresh pause.

## Changing an approved spec

Any later change to the Goal, an AC, or a TC — during execution, review, or re-planning — clears `Review:`, returns `Status: approved` to `planning`, and takes the plan back through review-feature and this pause. Never edit approved behavior in place.

This is not a deviation. A **deviation** is a different *means* to the same approved behavior: log it under `## Deviations` per CORE #5 and keep going. A change to the *behavior itself* comes back here. If you cannot tell which one you are looking at, it is this one.

## What is enforced, and what is not

`gate-check` blocks execution unless `Status: approved` **and** `Review: READY` are both set. That is the whole mechanical guarantee — it proves a review happened before the approval, and nothing more. It cannot tell who set either field, and no parser can check that an AC is the right AC.

So the pause is the enforcement, and the judgment lives in review-feature's adversarial self-check: can a TC pass while its AC fails, can every AC pass while the Goal fails. Treat a plan that reached `approved` without a human answering the question above as unapproved, whatever the file says.
